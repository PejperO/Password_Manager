## Password_Manager
A console application that allows you to store passwords securely. With it, you can restore the saved password, change it or add a new one. The program also has a built-in password generator, so you can create a secure password. The passwords themselves are encrypted and stored in several files. The interface itself is written legibly, and thanks to additional options such as sorting by name, it is easy to find what we are looking for. It also has a trace of recent activity, making it easy to check if someone has logged in between us.
